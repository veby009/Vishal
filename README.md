# 🛡️ Anomaly Detection in Enterprise Network Traffic  
**Machine Learning & Deep Learning for Threat Detection**

This project leverages both classical and deep learning techniques to detect cyber threats in enterprise-level network traffic data. Inspired by real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) use cases, the system is built using the [UNSW-NB15 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15) and includes 3 core notebooks.
